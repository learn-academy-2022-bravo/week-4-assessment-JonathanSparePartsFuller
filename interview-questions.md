# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: I don't know the exact definition of props, but I do know they are similar to state. My understanding is when you build a constructor in a class, it requires state to call upon the class, and to call that class from another file you need to use this.props instead of this.state. 

  Researched answer: Properties passed from the parent component to the child compoenent 



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: So a DOM is a document online markup which allows for documents to be view on the user interface, but as for a DOM event I'm not entirly sure. To me it sounds like it works to display whatever it needs to display to the user interface.

  Researched answer: DOM event allows JavaScript code to work on HTML elements.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: I'm don't know what that is or something I can relate it to. I will definetly look that up after this interview to find the answer though

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated.

  (Wasn't sure how to explain it)


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float in Ruby is basically an integer with a decimal point. They're both a number, but one just has that decimal point.

  Researched answer: A float contains a decimal point while an integer doesn't



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return is basically saying that what you want to be returned dosen't need to have the built in method "return". It just works without the need of it, but does work if the devoloper puts it there anyways.

  Researched answer: Returns the last line of code automatically without the 'return' keyword being used.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: Using the '@' symbol, you can store data into the object, which is similar to object-oriented programming.

2. PostgreSQL: An open source database manager used to store large amount of user data.

3. Ruby on Rails: An open source web application builder that uses the program language 'Ruby' to create the code.

4. ORM: An Object Relational Mapper. It means you don't have to manually call the database yourself; the ORM handles it for you.

5. Active Record: Active Record works with ORM and acts as the middle man between the database and the logic code.
